    Hello there! My name is Arundati Nayyar, and I'm a senior at Babson College, where I'm pursuing a degree in entrepreneurship. I have a passion for tea and innovation, which led me to start my own tea company called T3. Our mission at T3 is to provide our customers with high-quality tea blends and a unique tea experience.
    
    As a tea lover myself, I believe that tea is more than just a beverage - it's a way of life. Through T3, I aim to share my love of tea with others and help them discover the many benefits and flavors that tea has to offer.</p>
    
   <p>  I was born and raised in India, where tea is a huge part of the culture. When I moved to San Diego as a teenager, I was surprised to find that many people knew very little about tea and its many varieties. This experience inspired me to start T3 and create a website where people can learn about tea, its history, and cultural significance. I also learnt how to make Chai from my grandparents which holds a special place in my heart and I will be sharing some cool recipes as well! 
    
    I'm excited to share my passion for tea with you and invite you to join me on this journey of discovery. Thank you for visiting my website, and I look forward to connecting with you soon!
